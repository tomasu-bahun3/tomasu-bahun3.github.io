								<p>Hello, my name is Tom! You can find some examples of my academic work on the home page to get a sense of my Java abilities and skills.
									However, here I'll tell you a little about myself. </p>
								<p>Having graduated with a bachelor's degree in Political Science and History from the University of Southern Maine in 2015, I traveled to
									Japan to learn the language and pursue a career in international relations. However, I quickly found myself steering toward a more technical
									career path, and in 2018 I returned home and found employment as a digital content manager for a local nonprofit.
								</p>
								<p>I currently manage our website, databases, and tracking systems, while implementing solutions to IT issues. In addition, I am
									the organization's lead for cyber security training and ensuring that deliverables are met.
								</p>
								<p>Last year, I enrolled at Southern Maine Community College in the computer science and cyber security programs to further my studies and skills
									with advice from friends and colleagues working as developers.
									Here I have gained experience with Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more, while making use of Unified Modeling Language (UML), 
									collaborative tools/version control (such as Git), and much more. I have learned a lot and have an expected graduate date of December 2020. 
								</p>
								<p>It is my hope to find employment as a Software Developer and progress my career to the next level.</p>
